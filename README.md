🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
📁 Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes customer behavior, food preferences, restaurant performance, and sales trends using Zomato data. The dashboard is built to derive business insights like top-performing cities, weekly trends, user retention, and cuisine preferences through rich interactive visuals and DAX measures.

🧾 Dataset Description
The data model includes five interconnected tables:

food: Contains food category and cuisine details.

menu: Details about item types (veg/non-veg/others).

orders: Includes order date, user ID, and sales metrics.

restaurant: Holds restaurant ratings and locations.

users: Contains demographic data like age and gender.

These tables were cleaned and merged using relationships and joins inside Power BI's Model view.
